```javascript
package org.springframework.samples.petclinic;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ImportRuntimeHints;

/**
 * Entry point for the Pet Clinic application.
 */
@SpringBootApplication
@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)
public class PetClinicApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PetClinicApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### Refactoring Changes Made:
1. **Added a Class-Level Comment**: A brief comment was added to describe the purpose of the `PetClinicApplication` class, enhancing readability and maintainability.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Ensured consistent formatting and spacing for better readability.
3. **Removed Unused Imports**: Although there were no unused imports in this snippet, it's a good practice to check for and remove any unnecessary imports in larger files. 

This refactoring focuses on code cleanup by improving readability and maintainability without altering the functionality of the application.
