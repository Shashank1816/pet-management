To enhance modularity and separation of concerns in the Spring application, we can refactor the code by creating a dedicated configuration class for the application. This will help in organizing the application setup and make it easier to manage different configurations in the future. 

Hereâ€™s the refactored code:

```javascript
package org.springframework.samples.petclinic;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ImportRuntimeHints;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@SpringBootApplication
@ImportRuntimeHints(PetClinicRuntimeHints.class)
public class PetClinicApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PetClinicApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@Configuration
class PetClinicConfig {
    // Additional configuration can be added here in the future
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Modularization**: Introduced a separate configuration class `PetClinicConfig` to allow for future configurations and to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
2. **Code Organization**: This separation makes it easier to manage configurations and enhances readability.

This refactoring sets the stage for further modularization as the application grows, allowing for better organization of configuration-related code.
